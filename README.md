#  INTERNETALIVE  

**“The rebirth of the internet — real people, real stories, real connections.”**

##  The Idea
The internet today feels repetitive, artificial, and dominated by bots, ads, and algorithms.  
**INTERNETALIVE** is a movement to bring back authenticity online.  

-  No advertisements  
-  No bots or crawlers  
-  No promotions or engagement farming  
-  Just real people sharing stories, posts, and videos  

A digital space built for **humans first**, where every voice matters equally.
